# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Conversation-to-Notion Template Generator

## Executive Summary

Build an AI-powered tool that analyzes conversations and automatically generates structured Notion templates based on the conversation content, requirements, and user preferences identified within the dialogue.

## Problem Statement

Users often have detailed conversations about planning, organizing, or structuring content (like the YouTube planning conversation in our seed data), but translating these conversations into actionable, organized Notion templates requires manual work. This tool will automatically parse conversations and create corresponding Notion workspaces.

## Product Vision

Create a seamless bridge between conversational planning and structured digital organization by automatically generating customized Notion templates from conversation content.

## Core Features

### 1. Conversation Analysis Engine
- **Input**: Raw conversation text (like seed-convo.txt)
- **Processing**: 
  - Extract key topics, categories, and structure
  - Identify planning elements (schedules, checklists, trackers)
  - Detect user preferences (aesthetic style, workflow needs)
  - Parse actionable items and organizational requirements

### 2. Template Structure Generation
Based on the seed conversation, the system should detect and create:

#### Content Management Components:
- **Content Board**: Kanban-style board with status tags (Idea, Filmed, Edited, Posted)
- **Calendar View**: Date-based content scheduling with emoji titles
- **Content Ideas Database**: Searchable collection of video concepts

#### Planning & Workflow Components:
- **Weekly Routine Tracker**: Recurring task checklist
- **Filming Checklist**: Equipment and technique reminders
- **Growth Goals**: Monthly milestone tracking

#### Creative Components:
- **Moodboard**: Visual inspiration gallery
- **Artwork & Thumbnail Gallery**: File uploads with notes
- **Reflection Journal**: Prompted writing spaces

#### Analytics Components:
- **Performance Tracker**: Views, likes, comments, subscriber growth
- **"Little Wins" Log**: Positive milestone celebrations

### 3. Aesthetic Customization
From conversation context, detect style preferences:
- **Style Detection**: Parse words like "dreamy", "colorful", "kawaii"
- **Color Schemes**: Apply pastel palettes, soft pinks, lavenders, peaches
- **Icons & Emojis**: Contextually appropriate visual elements
- **Typography**: Soft, handwriting-style fonts where appropriate

### 4. Notion API Integration
- **Template Creation**: Use Notion API to programmatically build pages
- **Database Setup**: Create linked databases with proper relations
- **View Configuration**: Set up board, calendar, gallery, and table views
- **Property Assignment**: Configure tags, formulas, and data types
- **Page Hierarchy**: Organize template with logical parent-child structure

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python or Node.js
- **Conversation Processing**: OpenAI API or similar LLM for content analysis
- **Notion Integration**: Official Notion API
- **Configuration**: Environment-based API key management

### API Requirements
- **Input**: 
  - Conversation text (string/file)
  - User Notion API key
  - Optional: Style preferences override
- **Output**:
  - Notion template URL for duplication
  - JSON structure of created template
  - Success/error status

### Key Processing Steps
1. **Text Analysis**: Extract structure, preferences, and requirements
2. **Template Mapping**: Match conversation elements to Notion components
3. **API Orchestration**: Create pages, databases, and views via Notion API
4. **Relationship Setup**: Link databases and configure formulas
5. **Styling Application**: Apply colors, icons, and formatting
6. **Template Finalization**: Set permissions and generate shareable link

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
"As a content creator who has planned out my workflow in a conversation, I want to automatically generate a fully functional Notion workspace that matches my planning discussion, so I can immediately start using an organized system without manual setup."

### Secondary User Stories
- "As a user, I want the generated template to match the aesthetic style I mentioned in my conversation"
- "As a user, I want all the databases and views properly linked so my workflow is seamless"
- "As a user, I want to receive a shareable template link I can duplicate into my own Notion workspace"

## Success Metrics

### Functional Success
- [ ] Successfully parses conversation and identifies key organizational elements
- [ ] Creates Notion template with appropriate databases and views
- [ ] Applies correct styling based on conversation context
- [ ] Generates working shareable template link
- [ ] Template can be duplicated and used immediately

### Quality Success
- [ ] Generated template matches conversation requirements (>90% accuracy)
- [ ] All Notion components work properly (no broken links/formulas)
- [ ] Aesthetic styling matches user preferences from conversation
- [ ] Template is intuitive and usable without additional setup

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (MVP)
1. Basic conversation parsing for structure identification
2. Core Notion API integration for page/database creation
3. Simple template generation with basic views
4. Working shareable link generation

### Phase 2 (Enhancement)
1. Advanced aesthetic customization
2. Complex view configurations (formulas, advanced filters)
3. Multiple template types based on conversation category
4. Error handling and validation

### Phase 3 (Scale)
1. Multiple conversation format support
2. Template customization post-generation
3. Batch processing capabilities
4. Template gallery and sharing features

## Technical Constraints

- **API Limits**: Respect Notion API rate limits
- **Security**: Secure handling of user API keys
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure for invalid conversations or API issues
- **Performance**: Process conversations and generate templates within reasonable time (<5 minutes)

## Open Questions

1. Should the tool support multiple conversation formats beyond plain text?
2. How should we handle ambiguous or unclear conversation content?
3. Should there be a preview/approval step before template creation?
4. How do we handle conversations that don't map well to Notion structures?

## Example Input/Output

### Input (from seed-convo.txt):
- Conversation about YouTube planning
- Mentions "dreamy, colorful, kawaii" aesthetic
- Requests content board, calendar, analytics tracker, artwork gallery
- Specifies iPhone 13 Pro filming tips

### Expected Output:
- Notion template with pastel color scheme
- Content management database with Kanban board
- Calendar view with emoji-titled content ideas
- Analytics tracking database
- Artwork/thumbnail gallery
- Filming checklist page
- Reflection journal section
- All properly linked and styled

This PRD serves as the foundation for building a conversation-to-Notion template generator that can transform planning discussions into actionable, organized digital workspaces.
